## Mission & Vision

To define and promote open, reproducible, and automation-friendly standards for blockchain deployments — enabling consistent, secure, and efficient operation of blockchain networks across different infrastructures.

## The Problem

The blockchain ecosystem has matured rapidly, but each blockchain project implements its own unique, often inconsistent deployment practices. These differences create significant friction for node operators, validators, infrastructure providers, and DevOps engineers.

Current issues include:

- Inconsistent or incomplete documentation
- Unstandardized configuration formats and file structures
- Divergent packaging and deployment methods
- Difficult or manual setup steps that hinder automation and scalability
- Lack of formal release engineering standards for blockchain software

## Our Approach

BlockchainStandards.dev brings together blockchain developers, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure providers to collaboratively define and maintain deployment standards.

### What We Cover

- Node packaging and release engineering
- Configuration file conventions and validation
- Environment setup and dependency management
- Observability, metrics, and logging best practices
- Security and update mechanisms
- Deployment reproducibility

## Community & Governance

This project operates transparently and openly, inviting contributions from across the blockchain ecosystem. Standards evolve through community consensus and working groups that represent various blockchain platforms and infrastructure operators.
